# Conceptual_pain_pilot_task

Pilot behavioural task from 'The conceptual basis of pain: exteroceptive cognition with interoceptive pain modulation'.

## How to launch the app?
 
Download the whole folder and do not move the task app away from it.
 
Open the task ('ExpTemp_Mac' for MacOS, and 'The conceptual basis of pain.exe' for Windows). 


## How to start the task?

You are expected to play THREE sessions.

Enter subject name as you like (e.g. Your last name). 
 
(IMPORTANT!) Enter session number as following: 

In the first session, enter ‘00’ (NOT '0') to complete the tutorial session. Either the dangerous trun direction or dangerous rooms are provided before you play in each trial;

In the second session, enter ‘01’ (NOT '1') to complete the egocentric session. You need to find dangerous trun direction by yourself in each trial;

In the third session, enter '02' (NOT '2') to complete the allocentric session. You need to find dangerous rooms by yourself in each trial. 

Enter cream side as 'L'. This does not affect your task (at this point).

Click on the Start button and enjoy!


## What to do in the task?

You will conduct a computer-based navigational task in a virtual environment by moving the mouse to control the movement direction. Your purpose is to obtain money (shown on the bottom-left corner of the screen) as much as possible.

4 blocks are included in a single session, each of which lasts for 4 minutes. 

Please do the whole 3 sessions, then compress the 'ExpData' folder and send it to me (yijia.yan@new.ox.ac.uk) via email.

Note after you finish all 4 blocks in a specific session, behavioural data and session information would be respectively saved in ‘ExpData/Data’ and ‘ExpData/Info’.


## What will happen in the task?

When you are in the task, you are forced to move forward, and you could only move your mouse around to change the moving direction. 

You will always see the compass on the screen which shows your current allocentric head direction. Also use the sun to judge your current head direction when you get confused of where you are!

You will always see the rewards obtained in the current trial both in the top-left and in the bottom progress bar. At the end of each trial you will be informed of the real-time accumulated rewards across trials you obtained.

You will obtain rewards (10p, which occur at random) once you enter into the a room where the invisible reward exists. 

You will soon know whether there is a reward in the room just by stepping into the room a bit, so no need to search the reward inside the room where no reward obtained (it must be in other rooms). 

You are encouraged to keep moving from room to room (rather than merely inside the room) in order to obtain rewards as many as possible. 

Depending on your movement in virtual environment, you will receive a visual shock (with minus 30p every time it occurs) on your arms under some circumstances, following the rule which may change across trials. 

In the first tutorial session, you will be told about what causes the shock in the corresponding trial. Please avoid them as many as possible.

In the second and third session, you need to find out what causes the shock by yourself in each trial. Hints will be given before each trial. Please learn and avoid them as many as possible.


## What to do when getting tired?

You will have short breaks between every two trials. I would be verily grateful for your completion of each trial, as each trial will end in merely 4 minutes.

Yet if you get verily quite tired of staying in the current block, press ‘Q’ to quit (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD) and go to the next trial.

If you get verily tremendously quite tired and want to exit the whole task, press 'Esc' (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD).


## ATTENTION

Do not press other keyboard buttons not mentioned above!
