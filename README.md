# Conceptual_pain_pilot_task

Pilot behavioural task from 'The conceptual basis of pain: exteroceptive cognition with interoceptive pain modulation'.

## How to launch the app?
 
Download the whole folder and do not move the task app away from it.
 
Open the task ('CogPainLearningExp' for both MacOS and Windows). 

Notice this task is the version with real shocks. DM for the verison with visible monetary punishment instead of shocks.


## How to start the task?

You are expected to play THREE sessions.

Enter subject name as you like (e.g. Your last name). 
 
(IMPORTANT!) Enter session number as following: 

    In the first session, enter ‘00’ to complete the training session with 4 trials. 
    Either the dangerous trun direction or dangerous region are provided before you play in each trial;
    
    In the second session, enter ‘11’ to complete the egocentric session with 4 trials.
    You need to follow the instruction (finding dangerous truning direction/region by yourself) in each trial;
    
    In the third session, enter '12' to complete the allocentric session with 4 trials. 
    You need to follow the instruction (finding dangerous truning direction/region by yourself) in each trial.

Enter cream side as 'L'. This does not affect your task (at this point).

Click on the Start button and enjoy!


## What to do in the task?

You will conduct a computer-based navigational task in a virtual environment by moving the mouse to control the movement direction. Your purpose is to avoid shocks as many as possible.

4 trials are included in a single formal session, each of which lasts for 4 minutes. 

Please do the whole 3 sessions (including 1 training sessions with visible shock hints and 2 formal sessions with invisible real shocks), then compress the whole 'ExpData' folder and send it to yijia.yan@ndcn.ox.ac.uk

Note after you finish all trials in a specific session, behavioural data and session information would be respectively saved in ‘ExpData/Data’ and ‘ExpData/Info’.


## What will happen in the task?

This task is for a navigation in a 3-by-3 grid virtual maze. At the start of each trial you would be born in the centre room and face towards north.

You are forced to move forward, and you could only move your mouse/trackball/joystick around to change the moving direction. 

You will always see the compass on the screen which shows your current allocentric head direction. Also use the sun in the north (and a little bit west) to judge your current head direction when you get confused of where you are!

You will always see the rewards obtained in the current trial both in the top-left and in the bottom progress bar:

    You will obtain a coin (10p, invisible) every time you enter into the a new room. You need to step into the room a bit to obtain the coin.

    You are encouraged to keep moving from room to room in order to obtain rewards as many as possible. Staying in the same room would not give you a second coin unless you reach the other room.
    
    At the end of each trial you will be informed of the real-time accumulated rewards across trials you obtained. This counts for your final performance reward you could obtain after the experiment.

Depending on your movement in virtual environment, you will receive a visual shock (with minus 10p every time it occurs) on your arms under some circumstances, following the rule which may change across trials: 

    In the first tutorial session, you will be told about what causes the shock in the corresponding trial. Indications will be given before each trial. 
    
    In the second and third formal sessions, you need to find out what causes the shock by yourself in each trial.
    
    Your purpose is to learn and avoid these shocks as many as possible.


## What to do when getting tired?

You will have short breaks between every two trials. I would be verily grateful for your completion of each trial, as each trial will end in merely several minutes.

Yet if you get verily quite tired of staying in the current block, press ‘Q’ to quit (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD) and go to the next trial.

If you get verily tremendously quite tired and want to exit the whole task, press 'Esc' (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD).


## ATTENTION

Do not press other keyboard buttons not mentioned above!
